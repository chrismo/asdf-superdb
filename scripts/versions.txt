##
# type-checking: "This commit adds type checking to the semantic analyzer thus
# bringing static typing to dynamic data. As far as we know, this has not been
# done before in a general fashion in any SQL-like query language for dynamically
# typed data (e.g., SQL++, Asterix, search languages, etc)."
#
# "Type checking for built-in functions and aggregate functions is not yet done
# as we need support from the functions packages to provide type signatures. This
# will be done in a subsequent PR."
#
# From browsing the tests in the code, this could be 'breaking' in the sense that
# things that didn't error out before, but still weren't valid, now error out.
#
# For example: `values {x:{y:1,w:1},z:1} | drop x.y | drop x.y`. The second drop
# call prior to this build would just silently do nothing, but now it errors out.

# breaking changes:
# https://github.com/brimdata/super/pull/6286
# remove crop(), fill(), fit(), order(), and shape() in favor of cast()
#
# This may not be a stable build, as the type-checking change went in before
# this. And there's more code to come in regard to type-checking.
